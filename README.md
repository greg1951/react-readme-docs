# Master README ;-)
This public GitHub project contains the README files I created whilst going through Udemy React training. 

## GitHub Initialization Commands
After creating the GitHub repo, ran these commands to commit the files to the repo.

```sh
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/greg1951/react-readme-docs.git
git push -u origin main
git branch develop
git checkout develop
```
