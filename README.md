# Master README ;-)

This public GitHub project contains the README files I created whilst going through Udemy React training.

## GitHub Initialization Commands

After creating the GitHub repo, I ran these commands to commit the files to the repo.

If your are creating a Typescript project with Vite, be sure to copy in a good node .gitignore file before the git init command.

```sh
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/greg1951/react-readme-docs.git
git push -u origin main
git branch develop
git checkout develop
```
